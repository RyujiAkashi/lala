2nd revision:

- fix the size of the image named love
- fix the image of GoDraw (not visible)
- fix the toolbar icon sizes and make all of them images according to the resources i gave
- it should be (under, redo, delete,(add a little space or line in between) the shapes, select, image, text, font)
-i should be able to edit properties in the property sheet (not registering with any change at all)
- fix the status bar of the cursor (make it look better)
- add rendering for when I'm resizing or reshaping the shape (visual aid on what the shape is going to look like)
- use black as a default color for lines when generating shapes
- use the color black for the handles too
- render a line going through the handles which indicates the area of the shape
- delete is bugging out (errors)
- undo and redo is still buggy too
- disable undo or redo if it hasn't been used yet 
- make it so that the panels pop up in the middle (i.e. color chooser, etc.)


CSS123 Final Project - ZELDRIIIXXX
Project Requirements - these were recorded during the 3 meetings of discussing how the Final Project would be implemented, and transcribed to texts, then summarized.
1. Core Architecture
Project Type: Java Maven Project.
Pattern: You must strictly follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
Separation of Concerns:
Model: Holds all data (shape lists, properties). The Model must not know that the View or Controller exist.
View: Renders the UI (the canvas, toolbar, property sheet). It observes the Model for changes.
Controller: Handles all user input (mouse clicks, key presses, toolbar buttons) and updates the Model.
Service Layer: Business logic (like validation, complex calculations) should be in a Service layer, not in the Controller.
Code Quality: The project must pass Sonar (a static analysis tool) for code quality, complexity, and test coverage.

2. Toolbar & Drawing Tools
You need a main toolbar that includes:
Shape Tools:
Ellipse
Rectangle
Line
Image (This is a confirmed shape type)
Text
Property Controls:
Color Picker (for fill, line, and text)
Pin (for placement)
Line Style (solid, dashed, etc.)
Line Width
Font Changer (a dedicated button just for changing font settings)

3. Shape Workflow (Creating & Selecting)
Creation: The user creates a shape by pressing the mouse, dragging to set its bounds, and releasing the mouse.
Default Mode: After a user finishes drawing a shape (e.g., a rectangle), the active tool must automatically revert to the "Select" tool. This prevents the user from accidentally creating multiple shapes.
Selection:
Clicking a single shape selects it.
Dragging a "selection rectangle" selects all shapes within it.
Ctrl-Click allows for selecting multiple shapes.
Hollow Shape Selection: For shapes with no fill color (hollow), the selection must work when the user clicks near the shape's outline, not just in its empty center.

4. Property Sheet
Dynamic Content: The property sheet (a JPanel) must update immediately when a new shape is selected.
Relevancy: It must only show properties relevant to the selected shape (e.g., "Font" and "Text Content" should only appear if a Text shape is selected).
Live Updates: Changes made in the property sheet must immediately update the selected shape on the canvas (using a PropertyEventAdapter).

5. Graphics & Color Features
Transparency (Alpha): Your color model must support an Alpha channel (transparency from 0-255) in addition to RGB.
Gradients: The application must support gradient fills. Your shape model must store a start color, end color, and their respective alpha values.
Color Model: The Alpha property must be saved as part of the shape's data in the Model.

6. Undo / Redo (Command Pattern)
This is a critical requirement. You must implement the Command Pattern for all actions.
Undoable Actions:
Create Shape
Delete Shape
Update Shape (changing properties like color, size, or gradient)
Move Shape
Change Mode (e.g., changing the current tool)
Implementation: You will need two stacks (e.g., Deque<Command>) for undoStack and redoStack. Each command object must have execute() and unexecute() methods.

7. Saving & Loading (XML)
This section is now updated with the specific implementation details from the new transcript.
Format: You must save and load the drawing state using XML.
File Dialog: All "Open" and "Save" actions must be triggered from a menu and must use a file-dialog box for the user to select a file.
Exception Handling: All file I/O operations (reading or writing XML files) must be wrapped in try-catch blocks.
Save Logic (XML Creation):
Use a DocumentBuilder to create a new in-memory Document.
Create the root element: <drawing>.
Add attributes to the <drawing> element, such as the background color and fileName.
Iterate through all shapes in your Model.
For each shape, create a <shape> element.
Add attributes to the <shape> element for all its properties: type (e.g., "rectangle"), coordinates (start.x, start.y), dimensions (width, height), color, etc.
Image Shapes: For an image, you must add an exclusive fileName attribute (e.g., fileName="path/to/my/image.png") to its <shape> element.
Save Logic (Writing File):
Instantiate a TransformerFactory and use it to get a Transformer.
Create a DOMSource from your in-memory Document.
Create a StreamResult using the target file name.
Call transformer.transform(source, result) to write the XML to disk.
Load Logic (XML Parsing):
Use DocumentBuilderFactory and DocumentBuilder.
Call builder.parse(file) to load the XML file into a Document object (DOM).
Get a NodeList of all shapes by calling getElementsByTagName("shape").
Loop through this NodeList.
For each shape node, use getAttributes() to access its properties (using a Map is recommended for easy lookup).
Read the attributes (type, start.x, color, etc.) and use them to construct a new shape object (e.g., new Rectangle(...)) and add it to your Model.
Color Parsing (On Load): The color from the XML will be a string (e.g., "255,0,0"). You must split this string by the comma and parse each component into an integer to reconstruct the java.awt.Color object. Your parser should also handle the alpha value if it's included (e.g., "255,0,0,255").

8. Other Requirements
Input Validation: For numeric fields in the property sheet (like Line Width), you must validate the input. If a user types a non-integer (e.g., "S"), the text field's background should change color (e.g., to red) and the invalid value must be rejected.
Deletion Strategy: You need to support both:
Physical Delete: Removing the shape from the list.
Logical Delete (Marking): Flagging a shape as isDeleted = true but keeping it in the list (this is useful for the Undo command).
Save on Exit: The application must prompt the user to save any unsaved changes before it is allowed to close.
Suggested Enhancement (Status Bar): It is recommended you add a Status Bar at the bottom of the window that shows the live X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor.
