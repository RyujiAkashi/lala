COMPLY WITH ALL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BELOW:
(DO THEM ALL)


Previous Instructions:
you know how microsoft paint allows me to modify shapes i add? like scale, move, strectch? i want you to do something like tha too. using 8 handles for rectangle and ellips, while line only has 2 handles.
selectcommand
- i should be able to switch modes from draw mode or whatever to select command on the press of a button
- it selects a shape then the handles show up and it allows me to modify the shape when i press on the handles  while i should be able to move the shape if i press the middle.
- it should function using a searchservice
toolbar and menu bar
- remove the move and scale options, replace it with a select option
searchservice
- add a search radius for the handles when a shape is selected so i don't need to press and drag a specific pixel for me to reshape it.
selectionmode
- for handles, it's not suppposed to be in the actioncommand. it should be in this class.
- allows me to identify handles that allows me reshape and stretch according to the specifc handle i pressed with a locked pivot point on the opposite side/counterpart of the handler.
"select" case in drawingcontorller should allow me to search shapes in the panel when i select a certain shape
arrange the functions and logic behind the commands/services in their appropriate classes for cleanliness.
make the undo, redo, and delete functions work on resizing/stretching and moving

make sure the app still functions as is. i can still set colors, set fills, return to draw mode, etc.




A new set of instructions:

A personalized splash screen showing your picture and a button that launches the main application.   10%
Implement the property sheet to show the properties of the selected shape and the ability to modify these  properties via the property sheet.    40%
Implement the undo and redo functions for the undoable actions to include: setting the value of all shape properties,  creating, deleting the shape  40%
Enhancements to improve the look, feel experience.  10%


the property sheet table containg the things in my photo 
- right hand side 
- should update whenever I selected something
- i should also be able to modify the properties of the selected item (text, shape, image)
- a separate folder from draw and drawfx
- all things relating to the property sheet table should be encoded in here
- event listener listens to any changes made in the property sheet, and will modify the selected text, shape, or image
-  whenever a property is not in use, it should not show up at all.
list of properties: 
- shape type

- i should be able to select fonts, change font size, change text style, etc.
 (using a separate button in the toolbar; along with a dropdown option in the properties of the menu bar)
- i should be also be able to resize or reshape it

the logic shoud be designated to their respective classes, services, etc.
- they shouldn't be all bunched up in the one class
- assign them accordingly and use their pre made functions in their respective classes as much as possible
- what i  want is for the logic to be hidden (i just need to call on them for it to work)
- making it readable and understandabe
